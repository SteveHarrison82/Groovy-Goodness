Groovy has several <code>with...()</code> methods for <code>File</code>, <code>URL</code> or streams and writers, where <code>...</code> is the name of the reader or writer. We pass a closure to these methods and Groovy makes sure all readers and writers are closed correctly, even if exceptions are thrown in the closure.</p>
<pre class="brush:groovy">
def file = new File('sample.txt')

file.withWriter('UTF-8') {
    it.writeLine 'Adding this text to the file.'
}

def s 
file.withReader('UTF-8') {
    s = it.readLine()
}

assert 'Adding this text to the file.' == s
