For example we can pass closures as arguments to methods to execute them. We can create closures ourselves, but we can also convert a method to a closure with the <code>.&amp;</code> operator. And we can use the converted method just like a normal closure. Because Groovy can use Java objects we can also convert a Java method into a closure.
</p>
<p>Let's start with a simple Java class:</p>
<pre class="brush:java">
public class JavaObject {
 public static void javaSays(final String s) {
  System.out.println("Java says: Hello " + s + "!");
 }
}
</pre>
<p>With the following script we use this Java class and convert the <code>javaSays</code> method to a closure:</p>
<pre class="brush:groovy">
// Simple list with names.
def names = ['groovy', 'grails', 'mrhaki']

// Simple closure.
names.each { println 'Normal closure says: Hello ' + it + '!' }

// Groovy method to convert to closure.
def groovySays(s) {
 "Groovy says: Hello ${s}!"
}
// Use .&amp; syntax to convert method to closure.
names.each(this.&amp;groovySays)

// Convert Java method to closure and use it.
def javaSays = JavaObject.&amp;javaSays
names.each javaSays
</pre>
<p>If we run this script we get the following output:</p>
<pre class="brush:plain">
Normal closure says: Hello groovy!
Normal closure says: Hello grails!
Normal closure says: Hello mrhaki!
Groovy says: Hello groovy!
Groovy says: Hello grails!
Groovy says: Hello mrhaki!
Java says: Hello groovy!
Java says: Hello grails!
Java says: Hello mrhaki!
