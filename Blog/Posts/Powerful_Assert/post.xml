Before we only could see the assertion was false, but now we get a breakdown of all components used in the assertion. For each component the return value is shown, so we can easily determine what component is responsible for the false assertion.</p>
<p>For example we run the following code:</p>
<pre class="brush:groovy">
def list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
assert 4 == list.max() - 2
</pre>
<p>And the assert output is:</p>
<pre class="brush:plain;light:true">
assert 4 == list.max() - 2
         |  |    |     |
         |  |    5     3
         |  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
         false
</pre>
<p>We notice how the output shows the contents of the list, the output of <code>list.max()</code> and the result of <code>list.max() - 2</code>.</p>Hubert Klein Ikkinkhttps://plus.google.com/116304108087638220732noreply@blogger.com1
