This is closely related to the slashy String definition we already knew (which also can be multi-line by the way, added in Groovy 1.8), but with different escaping rules. We don't have to escape a slash if we use the dollar slashy String format, which we would have to do otherwise.</p><pre class="brush:groovy">def source = 'Read more about "Groovy" at http://mrhaki.blogspot.com/'

// 'Normal' slashy String, we need to escape / with \/
def regexp = /.*"(.*)".*\/(.*)\//  

def matcher = source =~ regexp
assert matcher[0][1] == 'Groovy'
assert matcher[0][2] == 'mrhaki.blogspot.com'

// Dollar slash String.
def regexpDollar = $/.*"(.*)".*/(.*)//$  

def matcherDollar = source =~ regexpDollar
assert matcherDollar[0][1] == 'Groovy'
assert matcherDollar[0][2] == 'mrhaki.blogspot.com'

def multiline = $/
Also multilines 
are supported.
